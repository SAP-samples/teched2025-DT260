# Exercise 3 - Analyze the Customer Dashboard application for clean core

The Customer Dashboard application belongs to the the Flight Evaluation application. It was developed with classic ABAP and is designed to display the data of the specific customer along with the collected flight feedback. 
In this exercise, you will analyze the Customer Dashboard application for ABAP Cloud and clean core, learn to understand clean core issues and why the new clean core ABAP test cockpit (ATC) checks significantly reduce the number of findings.

## Exercise 3.1 Analyze Customer Dashboard application for ABAP Cloud with ABAP test cockpit (ATC)

After completing these steps you will have understood how the Customer Dashboard application works and executed ABAP test cockpit (ATC) ABAP Cloud readiness checks to get the ATC result list of the incompatible issues with ABAP Cloud.

1. Start the Customer Dashboard application. Run the ABAP program  **`ZCUSTOMER_DASHBOARD`** by selecting it in the project explorer and clicking **F8** button. The program will be started in ABAP development tools for Eclipse embedded in the SAP GUI. Enter the customer id **27** as proposed on the screenshot and click **Execute** button.
